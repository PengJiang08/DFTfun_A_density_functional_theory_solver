The file contained in this folder are for following uses: 
1. CO.out 
This file contains outoput from gaussian software using the same settings as the ones in CO.m 
2. Gauss_COresult.m (as well as gauss2elec.m and elec_elec_gaussian_expand)
Run this file to attain the gaussian output of density matrix and two_electron integrals. This file only contains CO's calcualtion. 
This file also will output the inf norm error of the code's two_electron integral versus gaussian software's two electron integrals. 
3.eematrix_symmetry_test.m 
This file is used for checking the symmetry of the two electron integrals. 
4. energy decomposition
this code is used for getting the Kinetic enenrgy, potential enenrgy and electron electron repulsion enenrgy of the calculation. 
5. Wave function plot(wavefun_plot.m as well as several supporting files)
Plot the spefic wave function of interest

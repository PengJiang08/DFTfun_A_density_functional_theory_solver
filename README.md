# DFTfun_A_density_functional_theory_solver
This code used to be uploaded in MS's CodePlex, but since MS is shutting down CodePlex, this code is transfered to here.

This is a demonstrative code for Hartree-Fock and DFT (X-alpha functional only) learners. A detailed comment section is written inside the code, so that readers can comprehend the algorithm underlaying DFT and HF. Besides, this code also can calculate molecules involving second and third row atoms.
